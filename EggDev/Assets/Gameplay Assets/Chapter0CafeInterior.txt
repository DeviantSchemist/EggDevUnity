[neutral] Manager: “These are your coworkers! Most of them know what they’re doing, so if you need help, just go to them, not me.”
“Gale will teach you how to run the cash register. Beckett will show you how to greet and serve customers, and Eduardo will show you how to clean around here. Carter is in the back and he’ll show you how to cook. If I remember correctly though, you’re garbage at cooking, so just nod and pretend you’re interested.”

“Now it’s just like the old days, me and you hanging out together. I’ve been dying to see you again.”
“I know it’s hard to start working, but once you get used to the process it’s pretty easy.”
[neutral] “Well, this is the cash register. It hasn't changed much since we were kids. Do you remember when we played with this and my dad got so mad at us?”
